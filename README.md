## Tech stack

This is a React Template to get you up and running with the following
stack quickly:

### React

* [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), component based UI library
* [react-router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), keep UI in sync with the URL
* [material-ui@next](http://www.material-ui.com/), React components that implement Google's Material Design
* [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl), internationalisation support

### Redux

* [redux](http://redux.js.org/), predictable container for app state
* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), async support for redux actions
* [redux-api](https://github.com/lexich/redux-api), store REST API responses and status in redux
* [react-router-redux](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-redux), sync router state with redux
* [redux-act](https://github.com/pauldijou/redux-act), use actions themselves as references inside reducers

### Misc

* [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin), cache webpack output assets clientside
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/), various useful JavaScript utils

### Tools

* [babel](https://babeljs.io/), transpile ES6 and React's JSX syntax into ES5
* [webpack v2](https://webpack.github.io/), bundle everything together
* [eslint](http://eslint.org/), make sure your code is remotely sane, using [Airbnb's JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), painless JavaScript testing
